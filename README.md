This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Hosted transcription configuration

Licensed songs use a self-controlled Hugging Face ZeroGPU Space through the server-side Basic Pitch adapter. Set these variables in the server environment; do not prefix them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`:

```text
BASIC_PITCH_ENDPOINT=https://<owner>-<space>.hf.space
BASIC_PITCH_TOKEN=<server-only Hugging Face token>
BASIC_PITCH_API_NAME=predict
BASIC_PITCH_MODEL=basic-pitch
NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>/<database>?sslmode=require
```

The endpoint is the Space base URL. Sheetify uploads audio in memory, submits the Gradio queue, polls its SSE result, and retains only normalized note events. A deployed Space, valid token, ZeroGPU quota, and provider behavior still require live validation; tests use mocked fetch responses and do not establish those external gates.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
